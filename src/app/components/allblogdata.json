        "My neighborhood must have had influential Catholics on the school board because Barrington High School had first and second-year Latin as an elective. Ms. Benham refused to concede that Latin was mortua, and like acolytes or Brian in Monty Python’s Life of Brian, we would haltingly attempt to guess and then conjugate the accusative, imperative, dative or nominative (or whatever!) And like Brian’s Centurion interrogator, unless the formulation is perfectly correct, the words make no sense - instead of the graffiti throw-down 'Romans, Go Home!', the Roman soldier translates 'People called Romanes, they go to the house?'",
        "Now that I’ve spent considerable time under the surface of coding watching online code-alongs and YouTube tutorials, listening to applicable podcasts and hearing the jargon in Meetup presentations, I have become slightly less intimidated by code’s foreboding, unforgiving, foreign cast and its evasive logic. But I continue to wonder if coding languages are like Latin, or other dead languages, and with no shared dialogue – the back & forth of communication – if they contain no real kernel of 'language'.",
        "Here is an example of modern English: 'totes' is a sensible hipster answer to 'you interested in seeing the new Star Wars?'' But its dialect would stump Siri, because the meaning lies within the context, and inference eludes an algorithm. I think 'language' and linearity, 'language' and logic may be incompatible, and part of my struggle is trying to comprehend this stuff as a language.",
        "Javascript and Error messages and testing scripts – these remain advanced Greek to me - a dogmatic and confusing series of words whose precision lays in ambush, beyond my ability. I think code is like Trump, just needling me with 'Wrong! Wrong!' without helping me to understand. The lack of collaboration, code’s esoteric quality and the vast, vast world of required background information, makes fluency still seem nearly impossible."

        "'The Community' of programmers is an amazingly generous tribe of folks. Online, the Flatiron School pays folks to help make the big system run (to write and improve curriculum, etc!) and those folks are kind and patient but I’m not talking about them. One must pay a prettier penny to get their help. Instead, I lucked into a fantastic mentor the other day, one of the legend of experienced coders who volunteer to reach back and help some of us try to climb out of total obscurity. Drew had helped me before and I DM’d him to ask if I was anywhere near the right path on the damn Tic Tac Toe mindboggle.",
        "At one point during the next 4 (FOUR!) hours of mentoring, of gently guiding me toward comprehending a way forward ('Change 2 words and you’ve got it' 'We have to account for the fact that we’re checking each combo, not one'...), Drew commented that I could clean up my code a little, and sent me a simplified syntax of what I had cobbled from my limited skill and his consistent guidance. I stared at what he’d written, my brain whining and losing momentum, underpowered up the hill he’d just conjured on a whim.",
        "You think the solution is way more complex than it is sometimes. It’s simple simple.",
        "Perhaps. I hope so.", "At another point, he said that programmers see terseness as beautiful. I understand what Drew means, and I want to eventually acquire the ability to be terse, and write beautiful code. Right now, I’m still staring at the next huge black monoliths that appear on every page, wondering WTF.",
        "I feel exhausted. I stare at my pastel and jagged Ruby code.", "After a few hours, when I look back, I can see that I am erratically pressing into an infinite darkness. And I very gratefully acknowledge I couldn’t have come this far without mentors - who can see in the dark."
